# Command Center Playground: Getting Started

Welcome to the Stage 2 sandbox review! This walkthrough introduces the
symbolics workspace and the collaboration shelf that accompany the
mission controls.

## Objectives

1. Capture a symbolic relationship between drive parameters and mission
   telemetry.
2. Save the resulting exploration session so teammates can revisit the
   configuration.
3. Record a mission note describing the recommended follow-up analysis.

## Steps

1. Open the **Symbolics Sandbox** and enter `sin(x)**2 + cos(x)**2` as the
   baseline identity. Use the *Simplify* action to confirm the normalized
   form resolves to `1`.
2. Toggle the **Evaluate** switch and set `x` to `0.5` radians to inspect
   the numeric stability near perigee adjustments.
3. Navigate to **Sessions & Collaboration**, save the sandbox state under a
   memorable label, and add a note summarizing key findings.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Does the symbolic tooling produce the expected expressions?
- [ ] Can teammates discover shared sessions from the collaboration
      shelf?
- [ ] Are glossary references available inline during the walkthrough?

Capture any issues encountered during this tutorial in the Stage 2 review
log prior to the ML acceleration phase.
